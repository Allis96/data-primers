# Description of format

Oral history interviews are created and used as primary sources for research but are also seen as cultural objects in their own right. “Oral history” is an inclusive term that refers to both the process of conducting spoken interviews with participants (referred to as narrators) and the output products of that process.  Crossing disciplines oral histories may be a part of a historic record; belong to a cultural heritage society, used to confirm authenticity, use cases and testimonials, submitted as legal evidence, included in genealogy research and personal interest.
