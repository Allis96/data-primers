# Format Overview

|   Topic   |   Description   |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| What is qualitative data?  | Qualitative data can be wide-ranging, from the more traditional surveys and interviews, to photos and other images, to social media posts (Flick, 2014). The goal of analyzing qualitative data is to explore the experiences, interactions, and related materials to trace the relationships and help describe the phenomena being studied (Flick,2018). |
| Structure | Projects are often exported as packages of files to be loaded into other qualitative data software. |
| Primary fields or areas of use | Qualitative data is used by many different disciplines for a wide-variety of reasons, ranging from literature review to analyzing themes in interviews, datasets, images, and audiovisual materials. Common disciplines tend to be the social sciences, but many different fields could use these tools for qualitative or mixed methods research. <br>  <ul><li> Humanities </li> <li> Social Sciences: Political Science, Sociology </li> <li> Health Sciences: Public Health, Nursing, Health Services </li> <li> Qualitative or mixed-method researchers </li></ul> |
| Source and affiliation  | There are open-source and proprietary software options. <br> Proprietary: Nvivo (software) <br> ATLAS.ti (software) <br> Dedoose (browser based) <br> Open Source: <br> [qcoder](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/qcoder) (an R library for qualitative analysis of text) <br> [RQDA](http://rqda.r-forge.r-project.org/) (an R package for qualitative analysis of plain text) <br> [Taguette](https://www.taguette.org/) (open source qualitative analysis program that works on Windows, Mac, and Linux computers, as well as in-browser) |
| Software exchange standards  | The REFI-QDA Standard : <https://www.qdasoftware.org/> QuDEX - The Qualitative Data Exchange Schema (QuDEx). [Used by UK Data Archive](https://www.data-archive.ac.uk/sharing-best-practice/metadata-and-data-discovery/metadata-standards/) DDI Standard: [pdf](https://ddialliance.org/sites/default/files/AQualitativeDataModelForDDI.pdf) |
| Key questions for curation review | <ul><li> What is the minimal level of documentation (e.g.,
codebook, node structure, etc.) required to accept this
deposit in your repository? </li> <li> Which software was used? Which version of the software? Has this been recorded in the readme? </li> <li> Has the file been exported in a proprietary format or open source (e.g., in ATLAS.ti, one can export as an atlproj or an open source qualitative data format)? </li> <li> Which types of source formats were used for analysis (e.g., text, image, A/V, etc.)? </li> <li> Are there any potentially sensitive or protected data, including personally identifiable information? </li> <li> If the data have been anonymized, is there a record of what has been redacted or changed? </li> <li> Does the project include associated information, including codebook(s)? </li> <li> What contextual information about the coding and analytical process is crucial for the evaluation and interpretation of the published findings? </li></ul> |
| Tools for curation review  | Original software used to create the project, spreadsheet or text editor. |

# Scope

This qualitative data primer is designed to give data curators a grounding in what goes into evaluating qualitative datasets. This primer is software agnostic, focusing specifically on the specific needs of qualitative
data curation.

# What is Qualitative Data?

The definition of what counts as qualitative data has changed over time, but can be understood as empirical data that cannot be expressed numerically without losing important contextual information. This can include surveys, interviews, photographs, audiovisual materials, and social media posts. Qualitative research is conducted in numerous disciplines, and is often generated by mixed-methods design. Qualitative data lends itself to more holistic analysis than does quantitative data.
