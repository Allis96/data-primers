When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make by creating an issue, email, or other communications with the owners of this repository before making a change.
Please follow our code of conduct in all your interactions with the project.
#### Pull Request Process

The process described here has several goals:
- Maintain Data Curation Primerâ€™s quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible Data Curation Primers
- Enable a sustainable system for Data Curation Primer's maintainers to review contributions

Please use the attached templates (contributor.md, readme.md) at the end of this document to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:
1. Create/Update a README.md with details of changes to the interface, such as  line numbers of code modifications, purpose of modifications and references.
1. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is SemVer. For example, this is how we adapt SemVer for this guide: given a version number MAJOR.MINOR, increment the:
  + MAJOR version when you make major changes, such as adding new content,
  + MINOR version when you make small changes, such as fix formatting issues.
1. You may merge the Pull Request in once you get permission from the reviewer or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the reviewer to merge it for you.
1. Suggested process for making pull requests from people who are in the DCN: checkout a local branch, make edits, push it upstream, and then request a review.
