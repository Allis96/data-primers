# data-primers

This repository contains Data Curation Primers, which are concise resources meant to jumpstart the curation process for librarians or data curators. 

Data curation primers are being developed as part of the IMLS grant #RE-85-18-0040-18 "Building the Data Curation Community: Advancing Specialized Data Curation". Versioned primers in our Github repository are expected to be updated with new information over time.  Archival copies of the primer submissions (version 1.0 only) that were developed adjacent to our IMLS funded 2018-2020 workshops can be found at [University of Minnesota's DRUM repository](https://conservancy.umn.edu/handle/11299/202810).

Revisions to data curation primers can be made by forking the primer repository, making any preferred changes, then committing the revisions back to the original primer repository. Please see our [contributors guide](https://github.com/DataCurationNetwork/data-primers/blob/master/Contributors.md) for more information.
